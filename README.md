Task 04: Hand Gesture Recognition Model using CNN | Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology
ðŸš€ I'm thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed the fourth task of my Machine Learning internship, which focused on developing a deep learning-based hand gesture recognition model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

ðŸ“Œ Task Objective:To build a CNN model capable of accurately classifying different hand gestures from image data, enabling gesture-based control systems and enhancing human-computer interaction.

ðŸ›  Approach & Methodology:
Utilized a labeled Hand Gesture Dataset consisting of 10 different gesture classes like palm, fist, thumb, index, etc.
Applied preprocessing steps including resizing and normalization of gesture images.
Built a custom CNN architecture with Conv2D, BatchNormalization, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers.
Used categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer for model training.
Trained the model on 4000 images over 10 epochs and validated performance using test data.

ðŸ“Š Model Architecture Highlights:
3 convolutional blocks followed by fully connected layers.
Used Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Total parameters: ~1.3 million

âœ… Results & Evaluation:
Achieved a test accuracy of 100% with precision, recall, and F1-score all equal to 1.00 for every gesture class.
Visualized prediction results showing perfect match between predicted and actual gestures.
Training and validation curves show excellent convergence within just 10 epochs.

ðŸ’¡ Skills and Concepts Strengthened:
Hands-on with CNN architecture design and training.
Deep learning image classification with TensorFlow/Keras.
Performance tuning and evaluation using classification reports.
Model optimization with dropout and batch normalization.
Interpretation of training logs, confusion matrix, and precision metrics.

ðŸ“Œ Looking forward to the next challenge and continuing to grow in the field of Deep Learning and AI!
